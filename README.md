## Description

This is a small project to build a simple Morse code translator.


## Objectives

- Practice while and for loops, User input and if conditions.
- Handle wrong input.
- Handle excessive spaces inputted by user.
- Apply logic to solve the problem.
- Translate from Morse code to text and from text to Morse code.



### What I learned
 
The main takeaway has been how to use the for loop and how to iterate specially through two dimension arrays, both aspects have been key to solve the problem. 
This project had me thinking and trying different approaches for a few days. None of them worked until I stumble by chance upon the built-in method trim(), which unveiled the missing piece of the puzzle to solve it.<br>
After the project's completion, of course I've seen better and simpler solutions, nonetheless, I'm proud for not giving up and coming up with a suitable solution, specially taking into account the early stages of my coding career in which I am in right now, this is my first Java finished project.<br>
